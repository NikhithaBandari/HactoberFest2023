# In this code:

# 1. We use bitwise AND operations to separate the even bits (0, 2, 4, 6, etc.) and odd bits (1, 3, 5, 7, etc.) in the input number.
# 2. We then right-shift the even bits by 1 position and left-shift the odd bits by 1 position to swap them.
# 3. Finally, we combine the swapped even and odd bits using a bitwise OR operation to obtain the final result.
